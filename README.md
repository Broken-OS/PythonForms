# Python Forms
This python program allows you to create and send quizes to people. Please note that this is still in its alpha version.

# Useage
To use Python Forms, just open the form maker in python. When it is done, copy the string that prints out. The string will also be saved to answers.json.
To use Form-Reader.py, paste the string in answers.json, and run the file.

The API creates a function called LoadForm(f). The f varaible is the file name of the string. It will return and start the form.
